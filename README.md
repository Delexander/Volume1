# Algomorph
Algomorph is a VCV Rack module which helps with the construction of user-defined FM algorithms and allows for morphing between up to 3 of those algorithms.  

It is intended for use with modules capable of linear through-zero FM, such as Bogaudio FM-OP, Nysthi ÂµOPERATOR/TZOP, and Squinky Labs Kitchen Sink.

Instructions:

* Connect the output of up to four operators to the Operator Inputs.  
* Connect the same number of Modulation Outputs from Algomorph to the linear through-zero FM inputs of the operators.  
* Press an Operator Button followed by a Modulation Button to connect one operator to another. Repeat until you have built a desired algorithm.  
* After you have finished building your algorithm, press Algorithm Button 1 or 2 to build a new algorithm.  
* The Morph knob allows for crossfading between the stored algorithms. 12 o'clock is the currently selected algorithm, while 7 o'clock is one algorithm to the left and 5 o'clock is one algorithm to the right.  
* The CV input can also be used instead of (or in addition to) the knob, accepting +/-5V.
